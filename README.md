> [!WARNING]  
> **Update (Tailwind CSS v4+)**  
>  
> This is **not a bug** in Tailwind CSS.  
> Starting with **v4**, the standalone CLI is no longer included in the `tailwindcss` package.  
>  
> ✅ If you need the CLI (e.g., for `npx tailwindcss init`), install it separately:  
> ```bash
> npm install -D @tailwindcss/cli
> npx @tailwindcss/cli init
> ```  
>  
> ⚡ If you’re using **Vite**, you don’t need the CLI — just follow the official [Vite + Tailwind guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite).
